## Adding a New Widget

To add a new widget to Wigggle UI, you will need to modify several files.

Widgets are divided into categories such as `Clock`, `Weather`, `Calendar`, etc.

You would either:

- Put your new widget in an existing category or
- Create a new category for your widget.

Make sure categories follow the same naming convention.

- Category Name should be in title case and should be singular.
- Make sure categories are not duplicated. (e.g. Clock and Time)

### 1. Assign Widget to a Category

Check the category folders inside `registry/default/widgets` and create a file for your new widget. Every widget is a numbered file inside the category folder.

Widget Naming Convention:
**[CATEGORY-NAME]-[WIDGET-NUMBER].tsx**

Example:
**calendar-07.tsx**

### 2. Create Widget

Create the main widget in `registry/default/widgets/[CATEGORY-NAME]/[WIDGET-NUMBER].tsx`

```typescript
import React from 'react'

export default function WidgetDemo() {
  return (
    <div>
      This is your new Widget.
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2. Update Widgets config

Add your widget to the config in `config/widgets.ts`. Make sure you add the new widget to the correct category.

If you are adding a new category, make sure you add the boolean `isNew` to the category object.

```typescript
{
    slug: "calendar",
    name: "Calendar",
    widgets: [
      { name: "calendar-01" },
      { name: "calendar-02" },
      { name: "calendar-03" },
      { name: "calendar-04" },
      { name: "calendar-05" }, // Your new widget
    ],
    isNew: true, // If you are adding a new category
},
```

### 4. Update Registry

Once you add your widget to the config, you need to add it to the registry. The registry follows the same structure and config as `shadcn/ui registry`. You can check their [docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-item-json) to learn more.

#### Example widget entry

```json
{
    "name": "calendar-05",
    "type": "registry:component",
    "registryDependencies": [
        "https://wigggle-ui.vercel.app/r/widget.json",
        "https://wigggle-ui.vercel.app/r/badge.json",
        "https://wigggle-ui.vercel.app/r/label.json"
    ],
    "files": [
        {
            "path": "registry/default/widgets/calendar/calendar-05.tsx",
            "type": "registry:component"
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "tags": ["calendar"]
    }
},
```

#### Definitions

You can see the JSON Schema for `widget-number.json` [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/widget-item.json).

Make sure to add any necessary dependencies, tailwind configurations, or other properties as needed for your specific component.

### 6. Build registry

```bash
pnpm build:registry
```

### 7. Local testing

Once you have added your widget to the config and the registry, test your widget on your local machine. Make sure you cover the edge cases and test the widget in different environments.

Pointers:

- Test the widget in different environments such as Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte, etc.
- Test the widget in different themes such as light, dark, and system.
- Test the widget in different screen sizes and orientations.
- Test the widget in different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.
